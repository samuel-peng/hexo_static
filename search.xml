      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You know it, the classic word ladder problem. It turns out to be part 1 of my second assignment at <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Stanford&nbsp;University</span>.<br>For those of you who don’t know about word ladder (I doubt there is any), here’s a condensed version of the problem description.</p><blockquote><p>Input: a dictionary file and two words.<br>Objective: find a path to go from the first word to the second, by changing one letter each time.<br>Output: the path from word 1 to word two.</p></blockquote><p>Simple enough. However, the problem requires the program <em>not</em> to use <strong>recursion</strong> but use <strong>BFS</strong> to accomplish such task.</p>]]></content>
